                    <p>
                        I am an American-Israeli software developer and entrepreneur. I grew up in Herzliya, Israel, and moved to the USA with my family in 2003. I started programming at the young age of 11, doing projects that I thought were cool, and soon realized my love for all things technology. As I matured, I decided to pursue a career in the field I loved, and focused on learning as much as I could about programming and software development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After graduating high school, I studied for a year at the Engineering School of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, focusing on Computer Science. After studying at UIUC for a year, I began working in Atlanta for various companies, writing software and algorithms as an independent software developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As an independent developer, I have gotten a lot of experience working in small, medium, and large businesses, doing any sort of development that the companies need. I specializes in development, efficiency, and breaking things down in order to fix them and make them work better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I moved back to Israel in 2016 and started working as a software developer soon after arriving here. As a software developer, I've learned to design architectures, create services in various languages, and help companies scale to the next level.

                            A proprietary classification algorithm for Signals Analytics. The project entailed designing and developing a Natural Language Processing algorithm to take massive amounts of data points, each with its own text description, and then classify what each data point is talking about, based on a set of rules provided.

                            <p>
                                A set of web scrapers for IT Pros Philadelphia designed to extract information from various websites. The data was then manipulated into a format that was usable by the company, and placed into the company’s database and CRM.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This database was then populated with data about various clients, and a frontend page that used the data in the database to plot where each client was on a map, and display information about the client. The scrapers were primarily developed in Ruby, using various REST APIs to collect the data. The frontend was primarily developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.JS, Twitter Bootstrap CSS, and MySQL.
